Sources of Opacity
******************
Within the ejecta there are several sources of opacity for the :math:`\gamma`-rays that we need to take into account.

Compton Scattering
==================
Compton scattering occurs when a high frequency photon collides with an electron. Unlike Thomson scattering, during the collision some of the energy from the photon is transferred to the electron and the scattered photon is lower energy than the incident photon. 
This means that the scattered photon also has a lower frequency and a longer wavelength. In the simulation we assume that the electrons are moving significantly slower than the photons.
